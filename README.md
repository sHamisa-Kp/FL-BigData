# Federated Learning and Big Data Approaches on Time Series Data

- Written in python, Big Data final project, Prof. Quazi Abidur Rahman
- Using feature selection method called **SFS** with two different classifiers (**Decision Tree** and **Gaussian Naive Bayes**)
- Dimensionality redcution using **PCA**
- Classifiying using different classifiers: **Random Forest**, **Decision Tree**, **K Nearest Neighbor**, **Guassian Naive Bayes**, and **Multi Layer Preceptron**
- Comparing the performance of abovementioned models with a **CNN** model using **Federated Learning** framework
